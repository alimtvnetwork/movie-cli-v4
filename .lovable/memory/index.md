# Project Memory

## Core
Go 1.22 CLI project (NOT web). Binary: `mahin`. Module: `mahin-cli-v2`. Ignore Lovable build errors.
One file per command, max ~200 lines. Shared helpers in movie_info.go and movie_resolve.go.
File naming: `01-name-of-file.md`. Keep folder file counts small.
Plans & suggestions tracked in single files, not per-item files.
Never modify `.release` folder. Any code change bumps at least minor version.
Malaysia timezone (UTC+8) for timestamps. Milestones in `readm.txt`.
Root spec files: lowercase (spec.md, ai-handoff.md, development-log.md). Keep README.md uppercase.
Spec resequenced: foundation 01-06, app at 08, app-issues at 09. CI/CD at 12, self-update at 13.
Error spec flattened: spec/02-error-manage-spec/ (no nested subfolder).
cmd/ has 21 files, db/ has 6 files (including tags.go).
CI pipeline follows gitmap-v2 patterns: SHA dedup, parallel matrix, vulncheck, cross-compile.
